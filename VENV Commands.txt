# Before executing commands, first go to desired folder. Example: 
cd .\Projekt2

# Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Deactivate the virtual environment:
deactivate

# Install packages to virtual environment from requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Virtual environments should be excluded from git using a ".gitignore" file. 
# A "requirements.txt" file should be used instead to define required dependencies for the program.
